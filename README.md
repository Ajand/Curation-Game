yarn start
```

> in a third terminal window, 🛰 deploy your contract:

```bash

__Don't miss the help-abi! Since curation game smart contract system uses an internal contract it will help to copy its abi so if you don't run the command system simpley won't work__

# 📚 Documentation

System is mostly based on the specification and discord thread but I will add more docs soon. Also smart contracts are pretty readable and have meaningful test, so they would answer alot of questions.

📕 Read the specifications: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BnVxfHa59x_tR-H6BwvaKdfAq4xz7Q0L5w7Jz8Qj1b0/edit?usp=sharing
